Third project in the Web develop course by OpenClassroom

==> Project basics:

Ohmyfood: based on a mobile-first website mockup, develop the site with html and css in three versions: mobile, pad and desktop. Ohmyfood is an online meal ordering in gastronomic restaurants to prevent from waiting when arriving on location: the meals are already prepared. The site has an index page that refers to four restaurants' menus. As a "favorite" button will later allow to select the restaurant in a favorite list, the :hover and :focus effects on the heart icon are to be displayed: the heart must fill progressively. Every link has to have :hover effects at least. The icons are from the font awesome library.

Several visual effects are needed: dishes appear at restaurant's page launch, hearts fill themselves when :hover, a green box with a check icon appears from right when a dish is selected, and a loading spinner for the index page. For further information, report to the creative brief.

No framework is allowed, Sass is on opposite appreciated. The brief: Brief créatif - Ohmyfood!.pdf

==> Environment:

Locally, the project has been developed following the 7-1 pattern files organization in the assets/ directory. The IDE used is Visual Studio Code with extensions: Live server, and Prettier for preview and formatting. DevTools from Chrome and Firefox Dev editions have been used, and the html and css passed through W3C validator.
